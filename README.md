      Covid-Data-Exploration-With-SQL
 
I conducted a data exploration project analyzing a global dataset of COVID-19 infections and deaths using SQL. 
I investigated key trends, including identifying countries with the highest infection and mortality rates, 
analyzing the impact of vaccination rates, exploring the relationship between population density and case numbers, 
and visualizing the temporal trends of infections and deaths over time. This project allowed me to enhance my SQL skills, 
gain valuable insights into the pandemic, and deepen my understanding of data analysis methodologies.

Global & Geographic Analysis: Calculated death percentages and identified countries with the highest infection and death rates per capita.

Vaccination Impact: Explored the rollout's relationship to case trends by joining the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables.

Advanced SQL Techniques: Used CTEs, Temporary Tables, and Window Functions to perform complex calculations like rolling vaccination counts.

Production-Ready Output: Created a View to store cleaned data, making it ready for visualizations in tools like Power BI or Tableau.
